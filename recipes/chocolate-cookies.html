    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. 
            Beat in the egg. Gradually stir in the sifted ingredients to form a soft dough. 
            Divide dough into 2 pieces, flatten and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch in thickness. 
            Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. 
            Dough will be sticky so be sure to add more flour to the rolling surface as needed. 
            Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. 
            Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
